This project opened my eyes to how deep this field can be. It demonstrated how computers do exactly what you tell them to do, but rarely do what you want them to. This notion is both liberating and frustrating in the best way possible. 

My main aim was to squeeze the most unpredictability out of a small set of assets designed by myself. Although it may not be as important in an unlicensed project, exercising this principle is valuable practice for larger-scope projects where memory optimisation is an artform.
